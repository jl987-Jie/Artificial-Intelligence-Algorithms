			Negamax search is a variant form of minimax search
			that relies on the zero-sum property of a two-player game.<br>
			In Tic-Tac-Toe, we can set that the winner's reward is 1, and
			the loser's reward is -1. If it is a tie, either side's reward is 0.
			Then the game is simplied to a negamax strategy game.
			The algorithm replies on the fact max(a, b) = -min(-a, -b).
			Whenever Computer's Min Score shows 1, it indicates the computer will
			definitely win the game. Since our algorithm will check every
			possible move, it is guaranteed the computer will not lose. Therefore,
			the lower bound of computer's min score is 0.
